# Fourmi Py

**Fourmi Py** is a project that implements the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm in Python. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the Arcade library, providing a visual and interactive way to test and observe the algorithm in action.

## Features

- **Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm**: Implementation of the ACO algorithm to solve optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly interface created with the Arcade library, allowing users to visualize the algorithmâ€™s execution in real-time.
- **Visualization**: Real-time rendering of the colony's movement.
